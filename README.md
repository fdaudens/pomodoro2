## Running the App

When you first try to run the app, macOS might prevent it from opening because it's from an "unidentified developer". To open it:

1. Right-click (or Control-click) the app icon in the Applications folder.
2. Select "Open" from the context menu.
3. Click "Open" in the dialog box that appears.

After doing this once, you should be able to open the app normally in the future.

## Usage

1. Click on the timer icon in the menu bar to open the Pomodoro Timer.
2. Select your desired mode: Pomodoro (25 minutes), Short Break (5 minutes), or Long Break (15 minutes).
3. Click "Start" to begin the timer.
4. Work until the timer goes off.
5. Take a break when the timer notifies you.
6. Repeat the process to maintain productivity!
